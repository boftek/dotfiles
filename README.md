# Dotfiles

Welcome! \
\
This is the place where all my dotfiles are stored.\
In here I have configs of content such as WMs, applications, wallpapers and more...

### List of current configs in there

* Awesome WM
* SOWM
* sxhkd
* dmenu
* sowm-stuff & scripts
* bash files

### Usage

If you wish to use some of these configs (or maybe all of them) feel free to clone the repo and move the right stuff to right directories.

### TO-DO List

* Move awesome WM configs to separate repo
* Move SOWM & SOWM related stuff to separated repo
* Add config of compton, picom, rofi etc.
* Add README to all of those repos and configs inside this repo

### Modifications
Since this are only dotfiles which are the user made configs of some apps or setting it means that if you do not like some stuff in my config you can freely change it to your own likings.

### Contribute
If you have a better piece of code or maybe an idea on how can I improve some of the parts in code feel free to contact me or pull the code and fix it yourself!
